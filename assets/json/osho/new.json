        "card_english_content": "A fool is one who, despite being deceived again and again, does not learn anything from his past experiences. A fool is one who continues to trust others despite being deceived at every step. You deceive him again and again, he will believe you every time. Ultimately you will call him 'fool'.\nHe is a fool because his trust in you is beyond limits even after you cheat him again and again. Remember one thing here that he is a fool only until he has some kind of knowledge. What the so-called intelligent and knowledgeable people cannot understand, the fool can understand; Because the cunningness and cleverness of intelligent people closes his mind. A fool's faith and trust have reached such a level that you might betray him, but his trust in you will not waver even a bit.\nYou too become a fool according to your understanding of 'Tao' and 'Zen', but be careful not to build a wall of knowledge around yourself. After that, whatever experience you have, let it happen and then leave it there. Feel yourself healthy and fresh. Similarly, forget the sad incidents of your past that have happened continuously and try to live in the present. Make every day of your life feel new and happy; In the same way as a newborn baby would feel.\nGod says, 'Welcome into the Kingdom of God those who are like little children; Not little children!' Little children cannot enter there. They still have to pass through the worldly path; They have to taste worldly poison, which they will mistake for 'nectar'! After that they will start on the path of making themselves pure and pure. That experience will be enough for him. Therefore, only people 'not little children', 'like little children' are eligible to realize God; That is - those people, who have child-like innocence, like a fool!\nRemember one thing \u2013 having a child-like mentality or a fool-like innocence is not easy and not easy either! It will be very difficult for you to do this in the beginning, but it is not impossible, the world will take advantage of you by considering you a fool. He will serve his selfish interest by using you as a medium, but you should be rest assured. Let them do that. How poor and helpless such people are! Even if you have been cheated in the past; Even if they have been robbed again and again; Yet you allow it to happen; No response. No one can take away what is truly yours. No one can steal what is truly yours.",
        "card_discription": "At every moment, at every step, the fool leaves behind his past experiences. He doesn't learn anything from the events of his past. If anything remains with her, it is only her innocence, purity and faith, symbolized by the white rose in her hand. As a sample, the colors of 'Terot' are visible in the form of four elements on his 'waistcoat'. This indicates that he is completely 'peaceful' surrounded by the coordinated unity of all four elements. At this time his power of intuition is at its peak. At this moment, it seems as if the power of the entire universe has entered inside that fool! He is so full of self-confidence that he is ready to take a leap into some unknown place.\r\nThe card indicates that if you consistently trust the power of your intuition, you will never make a wrong decision. It is possible that your actions may seem foolish to others; It is also possible that you too think the same way. But this can happen only when you analyze it with a rational mind. For the fool the place of 'zero' is a calculation without any number, where his faith and his innocence are his guide, and not his past experience and disbelief!",

Existence is incomplete without you. No one can complete it except you. What a matter of great pride for you that the entire existence is incomplete without you! This is what you were born for.\r\nThe moment you feel that in every moment, every breath and every heartbeat you are feeling the joy of newness, new youth and revival; At that time you will be filled with extraordinary happiness and amazing happiness! At that time everything, even the sun, moon, stars, trees, plants, birds and animals etc. So much so that this entire universe will experience incompleteness in existence. No one will be able to complete it without you.\r\nThe entire existence is full of joy and happiness. You need to open the windows of your mind! The darkness in your mind is not someone else's creation but yours! Disharmony, lack of communication or hatred towards a particular person is created by you only. Recognize this truth. You are not a stranger to yourself. You are not unfamiliar with the trees, mountains, rivers etc. of this universe, nor are you unknown to them. This is our existence and we are a part of existence.\r\nThe heartbeat of our heart is part of the heartbeat of this universe.

Existence is always under our care, you do not need to believe in any 'savior' or any angel. These are all desires of the child-mindset. To believe in Jesus Christ to be free from suffering is only an imaginary attitude. In fact, this universe has complete existence. The one who operates or protects this world is its own existence. You are a part of this existence.\r\nAs a result of our struggle for personal achievements and fulfillment of personal aspirations, we have forgotten nature. The concept that nature is far away from us or that we are separate from nature is a product of our mind.\r\nYou are standing at that point in time; Where you have to realize whether you are ready to accept that extraordinary gift; What makes you feel at home in that place? If your response is positive, then enjoy every moment of your life, be proud of your overall existence. Feel yourself a unit of existence in this living universe, and then see your life filled with eternal joy.",

The truth is being edited through you. When you open your eyes, truth opens its eyes. When you close your eyes, truth closes its eyes.\r\nIt's a terrible experiment, a complicated meditation. If you understand this generally, then there is nothing else left for you to do, whatever you are doing is done through the truth. You are walking, that is the truth. When you sleep, truth rests; Whatever you speak speaks the truth. You are silent, that truth is silent. You feel silence and peace, that is the feeling of truth.\r\nThe moment you feel silent peace, that is the truth. That is silence! Silent peace means there is no sound inside you! Absence of all types of sounds, all types of sounds originate from the brain. In this void, your conscience inspires you in a certain direction. This guidance is not given through words or anyone's voice. This signal is wordless, completely silent; Otherwise it would have been absolutely impossible to find out the truth about what is the inner voice? Hence it is clear that no sound comes out in words from within.\r\nIn fact, when all kinds of sounds in the conscience become almost dead or complete silence prevails, in that situation your conscience becomes so capable that it can take your hand and go wherever it wants. The experience of silent silence of the conscience can be called a type of general 'meditation' or yoga method. By this simple method, gradually everything gets organized for you. Later you do not need any other technology. All your confusions end.\r\nWhen you get used to this type of method and feel complete inner well-being, you leave the 'meditation' method; And stop using medicines. You reach a state where you can live life as truth. You do not need any kind of memory system for life. Truth originates from the conscience; Whereas reaction is the product of the brain. When your life becomes the truth of the conscience, you will experience divine joy, fullness and freedom from your entire life. Life will become a musical prayer.

That crystal automatically expresses its purity and innocence, which goes beyond the prescribed limits and is received from the soul and God. The inner voice may also be playful or cheerful; Because sometimes it dives into the depth of emotions and sometimes it breaks all the barriers and goes further to the sky. This process is linked to the ordered world; In the picture, the crescent-shaped crown and the earth are represented by green leaves.\r\nSuch times often come in our lives; When we get attracted towards different types of sounds. In such a situation, all our confusions seem to remind us that in such noise we need to remain calm and self-centered. Only then can we hear the truth within us.",

When you yourself remain carefree and carefree; When your desires become completely calm, in such a situation some unknown force makes you anxious to become active in activities. That is a special state, where you have inner presence. In other words, that is your internal approach, how you see things! Not every person can be a painter and there is no need for it. If everyone became a painter, this beautiful world would become very ugly; Where it becomes difficult for us to live. Similarly, not everyone can be a dancer \u2013 there is no need; But every person can be an initiator.\r\nCreation can be done only by being in tune with the sound of existence. The moment you are creating something, whether it is a poem, a song, a music, a dance or whatever, you are included in existence; In other words at that time you become a part of existence. You cannot remain separated from the existence of this living universe for long. In fact, you disappear from existence in those moments and existence starts creating through you.\r\nWhatever you do, if you do it cheerfully, if you do it lovingly; If what you are creating is not economic; So that will be called your creation or that is your creativity. If the creativity sprouting in your heart wants to develop. So that is spirituality, it is called divine. The more creative you become, the more divine you become.\r\nIt is said in all the religions of the world that the creator of this universe is God. I don't know whether God is the creator or not, but I definitely know that the more creative you become, the more divine you will become. When your creativity reaches its peak, when your entire life becomes creative, then your life becomes divine. Therefore, God must definitely be the creator; Because the more creative a man becomes, the more divine potential develops within him.\r\nSo whatever you create, do it with love.

This power has no shape or form, yet all types of forms or shapes are created from the same power.\r\nIt does not matter what type of creation it is. The creation can be of painting or music, gardening or even cooking. The most important thing is the surgeon who performed your surgery; Did you get the shape you wanted or not? Just remember that your creation is not under you. His existence is not based on you. Creation is not related to us.

Every moment he has to face different types of problems; Because society has a system, a certain method and certain ideals. A rebel, or we can also call him a revolutionary, cannot follow those ideals and methods. He has to follow his own conscious voice.\r\nPeople are extremely afraid of such persons who have identified themselves. Such revolutionary persons have a certain power, a certain aura and magnetism, due to which the youth gets influenced by coming out of the circle of traditions and follows them. The revolutionary does not repeat the past in the present. He wants to bring something new into the world. Those people, who have hidden from the world and society, are called escapists or cowards. They have actually turned away from their responsibilities towards the country and society. But they do not understand that the moment they run away from their responsibilities, their freedom also disappears. These are the complexities of life, and this is the complexity of life that freedom and responsibilities both remain together or go away together.\r\nThose people who are self-conscious, no power can subjugate them; No one can enslave them. Those who have attained enlightenment are the biggest strangers in this world. Looking at them it doesn't seem like they can be associated with anyone. No institution, no society, no nation can imprison them, they cannot be kept within their limits; Because they are revolutionaries; Want to do something new for the society and nation - moving away from dilapidated traditions!",

The reflection of the sun falling on his shoulder and the torch held in his right hand symbolize that the person has achieved the light of truth by destroying various types of traditions and rotten orthodox beliefs through his own efforts. A truth in the light of which it is capable of providing something new. Whether he is rich or poor, he is an emperor in the true sense! He is his own king; Because till now he was kept tied by the chains of oppression and tyranny by the society. He has broken those chains with his strong morale and self-power.\r\nThat person has spread his wings to come out of the darkness and fly high in the sky through some invisible path, absorbing all the colors of the rainbow. Not because he is a traitor or a revolutionary, not because he is fighting against anyone or anything. In fact, because he has discovered his true nature and has determined to live accordingly. Garuda is the symbol of his enthusiasm, the messenger between earth and sky. The revolutionary challenges us to become as enthusiastic as him and fulfill the responsibility of living for the truth.\r\nThe revolutionary person, by becoming powerful, challenges us to assume and fulfill all the responsibilities. Along with that it challenges us to live the truth. A self-conscious person cannot be made a slave. Every talented person who has learned something finds it a little difficult to accept it. That person was in bondage till now, now his bonds have been broken. He cannot come under anyone's pressure.",

The word that can come close to it in the English language is - nothingness, but the word is not as beautiful and capable of expressing feelings as 'nothingness!'\r\nThe goal of 'meditation' is to create emptiness within you. But this 'emptiness' has nothing to do with negative thoughts; There is abundance in this emptiness and such abundance is exciting. There is so much excitement in this abundance that it starts overflowing; It starts spilling out. Buddha described such a state of emptiness as an overflowing flow of kindness and compassion.\r\nTherefore, we should create such 'void' within ourselves; Because such emptiness does not mean 'nothing!' It causes excitement in abundance.\r\nSuch a void which is absolutely empty, empty \u2013 it creates invisible fear in man. If the void created within you is empty, it is negative; So that is like death for you. Such emptiness creates darkness within you. Where there is no happiness, no joy! In such emptiness there is neither song, nor music, nor dance, nor any heartbeat. What it means to say is that your life is completely like hell. Then why do you suffer hell-like tortures in such a state of emptiness?",
        "card_discription": "A state of emptiness or emptiness can create a state of darkness and fear in the conscience. In such a situation nothing can be grasped; There is no path or direction in any direction. There is not even a hint of one's choice and the possibilities of achieving it. This was exactly the situation after the creation of the universe; From which there was immense potential to emerge and come into existence.\r\nAll you have to do is feel comfortable in this state of emptiness. Similarly, emptiness - in a state of absolutely silent peace, like between two words or between inhaling and exhaling the breath! In this situation, accumulate every free moment in which something new is going to arise.\r\nRemember here that 'emptiness' does not mean that there is nothing. The general meaning of emptiness is that it is complete. Here 'thing' means object. Every object has a definite shape. Therefore, the meaning of nothingness is no-thingness never means emptiness.\r\nEmptiness can have a definite meaning that there is something, rather than nothing at all. When the size of an object is fixed then that object becomes limited in its size. It cannot be called unlimited. Once we accept something or find its alternative, there too a definite shape of it emerges in the brain. All this is achieved after reaching the depth of meditation. This is the reality of human life.\r\nThoughts emerge in a state of emptiness. They have a fixed shape and then as soon as the thought changes, that shape disappears again. It cannot be hidden anywhere. Watch it take shape and even watch it disappear. Therefore, here zero cannot be used to mean 'nothing'.\r\nThus meditation is the medium to enter emptiness.",

Hence 'sex' is below love and compassion is above love. The state between these two (sex and compassion) is love. Very few people know what love really is? In the eyes of others, love is madness. This is the viewpoint of people who don't even know what love is! Ninety-nine out of a hundred people, unfortunately, think that sex is love, but it is not so. Sexual pleasure is full of animality. Although love may develop from it, it is not love.\r\nSexual pleasure can be transformed into love; But for that you have to be alert and alert; One has to become meditative by immersing himself in deep meditation. When your intensity becomes pure and sacred, you will feel that it transforms into love, compassion. To achieve physical pleasure, love based on physical beauty is momentary and brute, not permanent. Sex is like a seed; In which the flower in the growing plant is like love. Love-compassion is the fragrance spread by a flower!\r\nWhile explaining compassion, Buddha has said that the combination of love and meditation is compassion. When your love does not desire anything from anyone; When your love is no longer just a need or selfishness; When your love is meant to be shared with others; When your love is not a beggar, but a king, an emperor; When your love does not ask for anything in return; Instead of this, you should be ready to give everything only to others, you are getting happiness by sharing your inner happiness with others, at that time you should include 'Meditation' in your love, then you will feel that the divine essence comes out of it. The fragrance spreads. That is compassion, a wonderful thing compassion!\r\nThe fragrance of love spreads in the form of compassion; But intimacy is necessary in such love. Intimacy exists only where there is closeness. Where there is close and intimate attachment, we allow others to look into our inner self, so that they can try to understand us by going into the depths of our heart. In the modern era intimacy is gradually disappearing; The reason for this is that there is nothing in a person's heart which he can share with others. There is no love in such a heart, there is disorder and ego. Love is the only goal of life's journey. Once your goals are clear, your inner prosperity will begin to develop. All the wounds of the heart will blossom into lotuses. This is the secret of love and this is the magic of love. Love is the most powerful chemical in the world. The person who knows how to use the chemical of love reaches the pinnacle of success.",

If seen at the physical level, love is a caste attraction. Most of us have this level of love. The reason for this is that under the burden of our circumstances and expectations, our racial waves of sexual attraction remain suppressed. Love which is based on caste or sexual attraction never ends. This is the biggest problem of such love. If we accept this reality, we can truly enjoy sexual love; That's why! And when he is not there, say goodbye with gratitude.\r\nWhen we become accustomed and mature to this process, we can begin to experience such love. Love that exists outside of sexual attraction; A love that is full of self-respect for each other in the entire universe. Gradually we begin to understand that our partner often acts like a mirror, revealing a deep reflection of our inner feelings. There are no expectations or selfishness in this kind of love, there are no requirements, such love is completely free.

Awareness is not a part of the brain, rather awareness flows through the brain. The brain puts you into a state of paranoia; A kind of situation of inertia is created. Memories of the past become a burden on the mind. You continue to live, but with minimum expectations of life, not the maximum. The torch of awareness within you becomes dim; Because your mind is filled with the garbage of past thoughts, the light of the torch burning within you has dimmed. Remove those thoughts of the past that you have collected in your mind like layers of dust; The torch that has dimmed within you will shine again.\r\nYou use your brain to dream, imagine and go crazy.

That is, stop all kinds of thoughts coming! In such a situation you become aware. You begin to feel as if you are filled with awareness. The brain is a ride for you, you can ride on it whenever you want.\r\nNow you have become completely aware. Whatever you do, be determined not to do 'it'.

Love, prayer, birth, death, aesthetics, moments of blessedness etc. happen when you are alone; But who wants to be alone? Nobody wants to be alone. The biggest fear in this world is 'loneliness'. People can endure thousands of hardships; But cannot bear loneliness.\r\nWhen you are alone, you keep thinking about others. Loneliness is a negative state. In such a situation, different types of thoughts keep arising in your mind. In such a situation, such thoughts arise in your mind that at this moment, it would have been better if you had a friend, your wife, your loved one, your mother or your husband. But nothing like that.\r\nLoneliness is felt only when your\r\nindirect presence of no one\r\nWould have happened. But when you become part of a crowd, when you become part of devotees in a temple, church and mosque, you do not feel lonely. At that time you feel at ease.\r\nThe experience of loneliness in this world is truly a great miracle. This means that at that time you are not affiliated with any temple, mosque, church or any institution. Try to understand this situation. You are born alone and die alone. Both these moments are the greatest moments of life. Life begins and ends with loneliness.\r\nThere is a lot of difference between loneliness and isolation. Loneliness reveals the absence of others and solitude reveals one's own presence \u2013 loneliness is extremely positive. In loneliness you feel so complete within yourself that you can fill the entire universe with your presence, where no one else is needed.",

When we receive no support from others, we either experience loneliness, or bitterness, or no need for the approval of our friends, family members, and colleagues, as a result of the truth deep within us. Don't fall; In this way, we enjoy truth by remaining steadfast in our approach. If you are also facing this type of situation, then now is the time, become awake and determine your new attitude towards your 'loneliness'. In this way, fulfill your responsibilities with a new perspective. For that, strengthen your internal capacity.\r\nThe humble figure depicted in this card is spreading the aura emanating from within her everywhere. One of the meaningful teachings of Gautam Buddha is on the spiritual condition of human life.\r\n'Become your own light.' In the end, we all have to make the truth within us so powerful, acquire so much capability within ourselves that without anyone's support, help or guidance, we can come out of darkness and come into light and move forward on the path of development.

        "card_english_content": "Only the entry of something new inside you can transform you; Otherwise there is no other way for change or transformation.\r\nThe cycle of change in life continues continuously. Life keeps chasing death and death keeps chasing life. The changing cycle of time! Happiness is followed by sorrow and sorrow is followed by happiness; Love is always followed by hate and hate is always followed by love. Success is followed by failure and failure is followed by success. Lord Buddha has called the continuous flow of life and death as 'the cycle of life and death'.\r\nAny newness does not arise from within you, it always comes from outside. You have already established a pattern for living your life. You are hesitant in bringing any change or there is an invisible fear. While adopting any new thing, you do not want to forget your previous life. You want to live your life on one path; Because you believe in him. But when something new knocks at your door, your previous way of life starts to fall into disarray. If you accept any new idea or any new system in your life, then that newness transforms you and you experience change in yourself.\r\nOne thing is worth noting here. By accepting any newness in life, you will feel confused in yourself; Because you don't know where and how the new path will end. The previous part of your life is familiar; You have been colored in the same color for a long time. The new is completely unknown to you. The new can be your friend as well as your enemy. Only by accepting newness can you get the opportunity to recognize and assimilate it. You can't ignore this new path too much; Because your old way of living your previous life could not give you what you are looking for! Your previous way of life is not unknown to you, but it is certainly miserable.\r\nNow the question arises that how can our new transformation take place? Generally everyone wants to become new. This requires courage. Courage is also not ordinary; Requires extraordinary courage. There is no newness within us which we can present outside and experience newness in ourselves. Newness comes from outside only. Any newness enters from existence. The human brain always remains old. The brain is never new. Newness is a wonderful gift of existence that comes from outside.\r\nThe moment you accept the newness deep within your soul, a complete transformation can take place in you, which can also be called a complete transformation. You cannot bring change in your life yourself, you cannot bring any newness from within yourself. Newness in you always comes from outside. You can either accept that newness or reject it. If you reject Him, you will remain no more than a stone statue, completely abstract or dead. If you accept the new, it can make you as soft and fragrant as a flower, a new door can open in your life, where joy will be the only experience.",
        "card_discription": "The circle drawn in this card is a moving wheel, which symbolizes the cycle of time, the cycle of fate or the cycle of karma. The nebulae are rotating circularly around the circle. Pictures of twelve zodiac signs are visible inside the perimeter. In the inner part of the circle there are eight figures of 'I Ching' and below them, four powers in the four directions are shown in the form of light in the central part within a triangle. The rotating triangle is indicating upward divinity. In the central place of the triangle is the symbol of man and woman, which is shown in the form of creation and acceptance.\r\nIt is often said that if there is one thing in the world that never changes, it is the change in oneself. Change in life is continuous. The cycle of human birth, development, death and rebirth is always in motion. Overall adverse circumstances in man's life continue to play their role in his lifestyle. If you look at the outer edge of the circle, you will feel dizzy. If you turn towards the center within the circle, there is stability, peace in the center of the storm revolving around you and you will understand so much that you can come out of it.\r\nIf you want to bring change in your life, you will have to adopt something new. That too not in a fragmentary form, it has to be adopted deeply and completely. By doing this you can be transformed. You cannot bring anything new into your life, the new enters automatically. All you can do is either accept it or reject it. If you reject it, then understand that you have become just a stone block or have become completely closed or dead. If you accept or accept it, then you have become a flower whose buds are about to open.\r\nThus, when we accept something new in life, life begins from there. That newness is a messenger for you and the life after that is a message. Transformation in life can be achieved only when we hear the new, see the new and know the new. Although to achieve something new in the path of life, a kind of fear of the unknown is felt before accepting it. Instead of being afraid, you should embrace the newness. to do this\r\nWith this, your life will gradually move towards prosperity and one day you will feel yourself transformed.",

One of those words is \u2013 Break down i.e. to be in a state of collapse; In technical terms, it would be more appropriate to be in 'neuter gear'. The second word is Break Through, that is, to develop from the state of break down and move towards progress, that is, to enter the new world; Where you get a new perspective, new dream and new perspective.\r\nSuch a situation is a state of delirium in our life. At that time we are not aware of any meditation; At that time all our arguments become irrelevant. After this, the process of break through i.e. development begins. In that situation you enter a new world with a new outlook, new dreams and new perspective.\r\nWhen you ever get into this type of 'nervous breakdown' or delirium, don't panic; Don't worry. Face the challenge posed by such a devastating situation. In that case, do not be afraid that you are becoming a victim of madness! This is not right. In that situation you become heart oriented; Become self-centered, so that you can find a new path of progress to face the present challenge. In case of brain break down, gradually turn towards the conscience, from where the door to a new opportunity will open for you. In such a situation, the breakdown may turn into a breakthrough.\r\nBy the time you reach a state of breakdown, the structure of thoughts inside your brain has been shattered. You lose control over it. At such a moment that level of the brain becomes completely independent. Modern psychology indicates several disciplines in this subject; With the help of which you can come back to normal condition. In case of a breakdown your previous brain (previous collection of thoughts) has disappeared. In such a situation, a state of emptiness is created in your mind between the previous and next thoughts. From here the person is oriented towards the heart.\r\nThere are two levels of energy within us. The first level is very light or thin. In this first layer of energy we perform routine day-to-day tasks. Such as getting up from bed in the morning, taking breakfast after bathing, going to office or job, earning money and coming back home etc. are different types of tasks.\r\nWhen we are in a state of meditation, we get strength from the energy of the first layer within us. This is a new type of work; Because at that time the brain continues to work on its old pattern; New energy is not available. In such a situation, if you want to do anything at that moment, you will feel frustrated and tired. From there the breakthrough (development) starts within you. This is the second layer of energy in the brain, in which the energy is so sufficient that you will never feel tired.\r\nThe brain is a storehouse of contradictory thoughts. Different types of thoughts; Thinking, the complexities of thousands of thoughts keep fighting with each other; keeps making noise; And - they collide with each other and keep distracting you; Dispels your drowsiness. Thousands of thoughts keep dragging you towards themselves in a single moment. Even in such a situation, taking them all along is a miracle! Every thought in your mind wants to fight with you and pull you towards itself. In such a situation you fall into terrible confusion; This has been called the brain or mind. Where the functioning of the brain gets blocked and becomes in a state of breakdown. That is, it almost becomes dead.\r\nOne thing is worth noting here. There is no guarantee that every 'breakdown' will turn into a 'breakthrough'. Yes, it is certainly important that 'breakdown' can be 'breakthrough'; If that moment is used properly, then...!",

At that moment it seems to us that we should do something, anything\u2026' whereas it is a different matter if that thought of ours later reaches such a level that there may be some mistake in doing so; There may be a mistake; In such a situation, throw away whatever burden, obstacles and hindrances there are on the mind. These forces keep you confined within a circle. If you do not do this, your life will be filled with unrest, failure and complex problems.\r\nYou should abandon the ancient way of life and old beliefs and move forward on the new path of life with new zeal and enthusiasm. Fill your new life with happiness through this breakthrough.\r\nWhenever you drive a car, you have to change its gear. When you change gears, there comes a moment when that gear becomes neutral for some time. Now he has to roam around in the same situation. Neutral gear means no gear. Shifting from one gear to another. In the same way, a neutral state is created in your brain in the process of changing thoughts.

Spirituality flows within you automatically. Its origin is natural. When you get a new vision and a new perspective on life, understand that it is a new beginning in your life. There is a new way to maintain one's own existence. Whatever you have achieved till now in your life, you will have to leave the old to adopt a new path with a new vision. Now it has become your past. Therefore, do not carry the burden of the past on your shoulders any more; Because now he has become an unnecessary burden for you.\r\nLife is to live your present. The sad memories of the past will fill your present with poison, which is not possible for you to digest. Therefore, come out of the web of past and future and make yourself present in the present. The realization of the present is the realization of God. God is not a person whom you want to go to meet at some point. God is an experience; Your sense of disintegration and cessation; The feeling of your ego vanishing! When your ego becomes zero, then what else is left? The endless 'void' of mere existence, which is completely disorder-free and pure. Here 'zero' does not mean negativity. This 'void' is filled with fullness.\r\nYour old vision and old system are dead; In its place a new vision and new imagination have been born. The brain is an illusion.

This is a great insight that there is a clear difference in death.\r\nThink of it as a background or blackboard; Where life is written with white chalk. Death is like the deep darkness of night, in which the beginning of life is like the twinkling stars. If you destroy the darkness, eliminate it, then those twinkling stars become invisible. This is what happens during the day. The stars twinkling in the darkness of night do not go anywhere during the day, they remain there; But in the intense light of the sun we are not able to see the stars in the sky. They can be seen only after their difference becomes clear.\r\nThe possibility of a saint exists because of a sinner, that is, a saint does not exist without a sinner. Any thing has two aspects \u2013 positive and negative. Our perspective of looking at them may differ. If we accept it, we can transform the thing. Therefore, transformation is possible only in an accepting state.\r\nYou can transform the unbearable journey of your life, but for that you will have to become your own witness. There are three important steps to transformation: (1) Do not resist evil. (2) Know that your opponents are not actually opponents, but are worthy of your complement or compliment; They are indispensable for you. Therefore they are without options. (3) You become your own witness. Because if you become a witness to the sufferings and disasters you have experienced, you will be able to relate to them.\r\nWhen you become a witness to your own struggles, sufferings and failures, you will see a huge difference. But with that evidence you will be able to convert inferior or inferior metal into gold. With the help of that evidence you can become a scientist of your conscience. As a result of that evidence, you can transform your inner feelings. But this requires indomitable courage. People who stick to old traditions, rotten beliefs and convenient approach in their life; They may not be able to do any kind of transformation. Only those who have the courage to enter into a limitless existence by breaking the inconsistencies, disparities, reasons, apprehensions and all the bonds of the mind of life, are successful in transformation.\r\nMost of the people think that the path on which they are living their life is bright and joyful. If their answer is 'no', then they will definitely have to take the risk of rethinking their way of life and transforming the old path. For that, a new path, new lifestyle and new research will have to be adopted. Remember one thing here that you have nothing to lose in such a change. Till now you have not achieved any success, happiness or inner peace from your old lifestyle. The old way of life has become meaningless for you. A new path, new lifestyle, and new efforts can be meaningful in your life. For this you will have to have extraordinary courage and indomitable willpower. People who are infatuated with the old and are leading heavy lives, take the help of 'Philosophy' to make their meaningless things meaningful. They do not have the courage to break the old dilapidated system and come out. While others bring about a complete change in their life through transformation, and through the new way of life, they achieve everything which they could not achieve from their past.",

Broken chain of limitations means breaking all the bonds and coming out. He has kept one of his hands open in his lap, which is a symbol of openness and acceptability. The other hand is touching the face of a sleeping figure just below; Which is a symbol of silent peace.\r\nThis is the time when you can dig deep and reflect on your past lifestyle. By accepting the problems like sorrow, grief and obstacles etc. that come in your life, understand their reality. Make a new version of them.\r\nThe process of transformation is also like death. The time of transformation, like death, has its own time; Because it takes you from one dimension to another. This form of yours is external. Therefore, the process of transformation starts from the external form. If you muster indomitable courage, transformation can take place on the inside as well.\r\nTransfiguration is an authorized and authentic miracle. It transforms you in the same way as raw metal transforms into gold. Hope plays the most important role in this. By finding reasons from you, the language can be understood not by your intellectual mind but by listening without worrying about lies with your loving heart.\r\nYou can transform the most difficult journey of your life, the witness of which you will have to find yourself. As a result of that witnessing, you can transform your inner feelings. Those people who are living a heavy life due to old or dilapidated attachment, their only fault is that they are not able to break that system and come out.

Contradictory thoughts unless analyzed within; Unless there is complete certainty about them, they cannot be explained anywhere else. Therefore the contradiction should be ended within. Politics is a situation within you. It has its presence between two parts of the mind. The bridge built between you and existence is very short. If that bridge collapses due to some accident, whether it is due to vandalism, or any psychological reason, whatever the reason may be; If this happens, the person gets divided into two parts and he becomes two 'individuals' inside.\r\nTherefore, a person should eliminate the 'two personalities' or contradictions created within him; Integrate them. His existence is always alive; Otherwise you would not exist. Take a bullock cart for example. The bullock cart is moving, moving forward. His wheel is moving, rotating; Because its center is stable. The wheel rotates on its axis (Hub). In the same way your life is also revolving around the center point of existence; Is dynamic.\r\nTo know and see the center of the life cycle within you, you will have to create insight. Insight means looking within yourself. Keep your eyes moving away from yourself. peaceful mind\r\nKeep it open. Keep your hands extended outwards. to the legs\r\nsit dawn. Experience peace within the periphery; In the next process, close your eyes and immediately go within yourself. At that time there should not be any disorder, any thinking or any kind of excitement in your mind. If you allow this process to happen normally, you will reach deeper into the inner plane. You will feel as if you have broken through the clouds and reached the shining center!\r\nThis is a beautiful meditation. You can try for this several times during the twenty-four hours of the day and night. Stop suddenly for half a second; So you will feel that the circumference of the world is constantly moving, but you are not there. When you become very conscious of the fact that the world will continue to exist without you, you will be able to interpret the other part of the personality within you; Which has been neglected for a long time. You reach deep inside your mind. The deeper you sink, the more you will gain. Because your integration is done.

His inner self is complete and satisfied. We integrate the swan and the eagle within us; Form a pair.

Self-respect is a guarantee of existence; Whereas personality is the gift of society; It is a facility provided by the society. The identity of your personality given by society is masking your real identity. See an example of a beautiful moral story in this regard.\r\nA pregnant lioness was crossing the road by jumping on high mountain ridges when during that time she gave birth to a child. The child fell into the herd of sheep grazing below. The sheep took care of the lioness's cub and raised it, but they did not know that it was the cub of a lion, the enemy of the sheep. Even the lion did not know that he was a lion's child; Because there was a herd of sheep all around him. Therefore, that lion also lives in the company of sheep and walks, eats, drinks, runs and speaks in the same way like a sheep. The lion cub never knew he was a lion! The reason for this was that from birth till he grew up, he lived in a herd of sheep. That is why his eating, drinking, walking, running, speaking etc. everything was like that of a sheep.\r\nThe lion, the king of the jungle, always roams alone. Lions never live in packs. With one of his roars, the entire surrounding area, animals and creatures etc. tremble. But in that lion living with the sheep, everything except the physical structure was similar to that of the sheep. Gradually he had grown up, but he did not know that he was a lion.\r\nOne day when an old lion saw that scene, he could not believe his eyes! Till now in his life, he had never seen a lion roaming around like a sheep in a herd of sheep. There was no possibility of friendship between the two. The old lion could not believe his eyes at all. He suddenly ran towards the sheep and all the sheep started running away screaming. The young lion also screamed in the same manner and started running away in fear. With great difficulty the old lion managed to catch the young lion; But the young lion kept crying, screaming and trembling like a sheep.\r\nThe old lion dragged the young lion to a pond. The young lion was so powerful that if he had known that he was a lion, the old lion would not have been able to even touch him! But he had become a sheep. That's why he was scared, he was trembling.\r\nA miracle happened on the pond. The old lion encouraged the young lion to look inside the well. While peeping into the pond, their images were visible in the water. As soon as he saw his own reflection he transformed into a young lion; Because in reality it was not a sheep! His personality was like that of a sheep, because his external personality was formed in the society of sheep. When the young lion saw his form for the first time, a roar came from within him, which echoed to the surrounding hills. The lion found his true identity, who he really is?\r\nExternal factors play important roles in the structure of your personality. Society, civilization, education, etc. have a special role in building your personality. What this means is that your personality is given to you by others. Look at a four-five year old child; Whose personality has not yet developed. It will still take a long time. Therefore, at this time that four-five year old child is his own personality, that is his identity. He has not yet been influenced by external thoughts, to understand this you turn back to your past. Reach there, when you would have been a small child of about three-four years. At this time, try to feel like a three-four year old child, but you will not remember anything. From then till now a long gap of time has formed. You will not remember anything because you had no personality at that time. When you were born on this earth, you did not have any name. You received education, studied and attained a certain qualification. When you were born, you were neither an engineer, nor a doctor, nor a professor. All these abilities kept getting added to you. Your name, degree, your fame... etc. characteristics became associated with you and became the identity of your personality. In that personality you were buried under many layers. If your personality made up of external factors is taken out, you will be left like a zero blank slate. That is your real identity. Your real personality is what you feel is best. Quite apart from the external personality, you are not what you learned from others; That is your personality. You have to regain your disorder-free, innocent form. That is your real identity.",

They don't want to remember him; Because by remembering they fear that their ego might get shattered. And if this happens, it is possible that they may be hit by a thunderbolt. The more we achieve in this life, the more we desire to give it up and we keep forgetting it. If a small glimpse of truth comes into your vision, your mentality will get confused. Movement will begin to arise in the brain. You will become confused and unable to understand anything.\r\nSometimes it also happens that when you are in deep sleep, something happens that suddenly you wake up. It is generally seen that when we come out of deep sleep, we gradually come into a state of complete wakefulness. First of all we give up deep sleep; After this the dreams gradually disappear while floating; The existence of dreams lasts only for a brief moment. But on the contrary, sometimes it also happens that suddenly something happens that we come out of deep sleep like an arrow and come straight into the waking state. In that situation your eyes remain open and you keep wondering, 'Where am I?' 'Who am I?' Nothing becomes clear for a moment; You lose all your identity. At such moments you feel as if you have arrived in a different world! But keep in mind that it feels like this only for a moment. The very next moment you return to normal state.\r\nThis is not a big shock. This happens every day in our lives. You wake up early every morning. At that time you return from the dream world to the waking world. This is your normal routine; But sometimes when this process happens suddenly, you are shocked; Become frightened. When you are truly awake, you become completely speechless. At that time you are not aware of what has happened! At that time everything becomes calm and silent. Only those who make sacrifices attain the real joy of life; Stay away from accepting something. The more a man achieves in this world, in this life, the more he moves forward to achieve more with the desire to give up. This is a contradiction. Even all the rules of life are full of contradictions.\r\nYou cannot limit anything in your life. The more tightly you try to hold any object, the more easily that object will slip from your hand. An open hand is never empty; And a closed fist is always empty. Holding on to anything in life is sheer foolishness. The biggest mistake is to keep something in your grip. By doing this the person loses everything that he was going to get.",

This silence is completely visible and tactile.\r\nOuter peace cannot be compared to inner peace. If a person goes into a forest; If you go to mountains and caves, you will definitely experience a kind of silence or peace; But this is actually a negative peace. One experiences peace there because there is no noise of the market; There is no traffic noise there. Not the roar of a flying airplane; There is no noise of barking dogs and crowd of humans. That's why there is silence; Because there is absence of noise; But that is not real peace; There is a negative silence.\r\nYou are nothing alone. The entire existence has complete dominance over you. The total force of existence has complete authority over you. In such a moment, when silence penetrates inside you, at that moment you understand its power. It happens suddenly. Gautam Buddha had a similar experience; Which he called 'zero'. In other words, such power or silence can be called 'silence'. Which is spread in the depth of your conscience. You can experience real peace or total silence only when you focus your attention deep within your inner self away from the explosive hustle and bustle of the external environment. Such peace and such silence is present within you.\r\nThere are very few people among us who really like peace or silence. Although many people say that they like to live in peace or silence. But when the moment comes to remain quiet or silent, they do not like to remain silent or quiet. They immediately turn towards some play or entertainment. Some activity or the other starts. They become frightened by the atmosphere of silence. The more silent you remain, the more invisible your existence becomes. As long as your mind is in control of you, you are the embodiment of noise. The center point of noise and commotion is your ego. In these moments of terrible noise and destruction, when your mind becomes invisible, when your mind becomes in a state of 'nothingness'; So instead of noise, a strange silence prevails. At that time both your mind and your ego disappear like steam.\r\nIf a person loves peace or silence, it is certain that he loves the entire existence. Love of existence will be called love of the purest form of religion. Unless there is silence deep within your conscience, you cannot assess things correctly.

You should measure the peace located deep within your soul, where the silence of the entire universe meets.\r\nNow you have nothing left to do. Don't go anywhere else. The peace within you allows you to do anything. The silence of your conscience may cause discomfort to some people; Which has become a unit of noise of the outside world.

In the same way, the kind of child who has playful eyes and speaks stammering words.\r\nYour basic nature is innocent and guileless; You don't have to be innocent. You are innocent and innocent by birth. After birth, as soon as you reach the age of three-four years, your innocence is gradually covered with external knowledge, layer by layer. The name given by the society and layers of different types of knowledge got accumulated on your innocence and all this became your identity and your personality.

To get out of confusion we have to be a little alert; Because knowingly or unknowingly we keep chasing dreams in the world of illusion. In the same dreamland we pile up our hopes.\r\nOur mind or brain survives in the world of illusion. What we call mind or brain is nothing but all those misconceptions which you have stored in your brain; It is piled up. These illusions are of different types, like illusion of memories, illusion of imagination, illusion of dreams, illusion of hopes and desires. At the root of all these misconceptions is a great illusion \u2013 the ego of \u2018I am\u2019. All kinds of misconceptions revolve around this. Between these two your reality gets destroyed.\r\nThe simple meaning of meditation is to come out of the confusing circle of dreams, aspirations, imaginations and past and future, which are wrapped around you like a blanket. At such a moment, completely coming out of these illusory factors and not having any thoughts in your mind at that time is your real identity; That is your reality. To come out of misconceptions, you should set immediate goals; Because we have been carrying these misconceptions in our lives for a long time. In other words, it has become your habit to live life under the influence of illusion or illusion. The hopes of your life are alive in those illusions. We are alive with the help of those hopes. To give up on them means to give up on the future; Abandon all hope! How can we carry our present without hope?\r\nLiving your present without any hope or expectation is an art, but remember one thing here that living a life without hope does not mean living a life with despair. The general meaning of a life without hope is - the present is so beautiful that who should worry about the future! Who can bear the imaginary burden of the future in the present? One is the person whose present is empty and full of despair; But there is one whose present is so beautiful and perfect that he has no space to think about the future.\r\nThe person who lives a life full of disappointments, his life remains empty. He doesn't know what the present is? The future of such a person becomes invisible. There are lakhs and crores of such people in the world, who get crushed between the stones of past and future and ultimately become the grip of death. Living a life without hope or expectations means living in the present. Always think that there is no tomorrow. Whatever we see, whatever appears before us, is the present. If you adopt such an approach in your life, then understand that a new life has been infused within you.\r\nOften we think only about the past and future, because our present remains completely empty. We don't know at all how to live those moments! The result is that, either we live the past in the present which no longer matters; The future has no meaning in the present. The moments between the two are everything in life.\r\nThe correct meaning of ILLUSION in the English language cannot be illusion or delusion. Where there is confusion, we mistakenly consider one thing to be another thing. Whereas it is not so here. In the darkness of the night, we jump on a piece of rope lying on the road, mistaking it for a snake, but immediately the illusion breaks and we come out of the illusion. But after slipping from our present, we keep running towards past and future under illusion, in which there is illusion of beautiful dream coming true and that is Maya! If you throw it away, your beautiful present will be visible in your vision and not the emptiness of past and future.",

Meditation emerges in the inner part only with the rising sun.\r\nThe card reminds you to look within yourself instead of wandering in the outer world to recognize reality. When we look at our outer shell, often we too are not able to take the right decision amidst the confusion of true and false, good and bad, love-hate, hope-disappointment, etc. Therefore, if you look at all these misconceptions, when you return to the depths of your soul, you will clearly understand the difference between dreams and reality.\r\nGenerally people think mostly about the past and future. Whereas past and future do not exist. The result is that we destroy our present by thinking about the invisible consequences of the past and future. If we start living between past and future then life can be happy. There is often a fear of snakes after seeing a rope lying on the road in the dark of night. This is our illusion. When we realize the truth, our illusions are shattered. Living a life without hope or expectations means living in the present.\r\nWhatever we see, whatever is visible in front of us and whatever is present around us is our present. The past cannot be brought into the present; Whereas what is going to happen in the future is all invisible.

The mind always tries to make everything complete, completely perfect. This is also necessary; Otherwise life will become impossible. Every person in this world has taken a wrong path of living, which is actually an incomplete life. Nothing ends and you set out to make a new beginning. All those incomplete things or entanglements of incompleteness come together and become a heavy burden on the brain. They are never complete, but become a permanent burden on the mind.\r\nIf you really want to avoid this irony, be holistic in everything you do. Don't start anything new until you have finished what is just beginning. If you are taking a bath, then enjoy the bath in the falling water and get completely satisfied with the bath, only then come out. If you leave it incomplete, that incompleteness will keep following you like a reflection.\r\nWhatever you are doing, perfect it. There is no hurry in the work, do it with complete patience so that the mind gets saturated and the heart gets satisfied only then leave it. If you are angry, be completely angry, if you try to laugh in anger, then that is your incompleteness, incompleteness of life.\r\nYou are angry, but smiling! In such a situation, anger will not leave you. You can deceive the world, but your inner soul knows very well that the smile spread on your face when you are angry is false. At that time your anger remains present within you. So don't live your life wrongly; Wrong life means incomplete life. Live every moment of life as if there is no other moment for you.

When you sit under a tree after a long walk, and the cool morning breeze blows, it fills you with freshness. Whatever you are doing, remain completely calm and at ease within yourself. In today's stressful world, everyone is in a hurry; There is a hurry. Everyone is in a hurry; But don't know the reason! He who has nowhere to go is also in a hurry.

By slowing down even your ordinary activities, you will experience amazing peace. Chew while eating and eat peacefully. Similarly, keep each of your normal processes slow. If you take twenty minutes to eat food, why not forty minutes? If you eat the food comfortably and chew it thoroughly, then the digestion process will also be easy. Sometimes there comes a time when you don't do anything; Just sit quietly or watch TV. Don't even look. By doing this you have nothing to do. At that time you sit down. Even at that time you 'newspaper' should protect itself from unnecessary interference. Sometimes when you have nothing to do; You are completely empty and silent, so you should feel happy that you have free time - sit quietly, look at the stars and constellations and the trees and plants on the earth; Close your eyes and look into your inner self.\r\nhappiness and sorrow; peace and unrest; Satisfaction and dissatisfaction; These are all options of the mind. Leave negativity and always have a positive attitude; All your problems will be solved automatically.

Unless a person knows what real peace is, he cannot even know what life is.

There is no need to rush, no need to seek shelter elsewhere. The deeper we go into the ocean of emotions, the more satisfied, self-centered and free we feel. Having high expectations from someone becomes a cause of sadness and worry. At such times, give up all expectations; Along with that, break and disintegrate the web of illusion that you have woven for yourself. You don't need to do anything at this time; No need to bear any responsibility; Whatever you are, be completely relaxed. It would be best for you if all your wishes, hopes and dreams for the future were put on hold. When the unnecessary burden on your mind is removed, that empty space will be filled with a new kind of determination, confidence and receptivity. Then you will welcome your new growth; You will feel so confident in yourself that you have never felt before!

If you come out of the periphery of the mind, then understand that you have been truly born; That means you have come out of the grave!\r\nOne can live every moment of one's life with curiosity; Can live with courage. Every moment of it becomes a great gift; Because that moment brings a lot of happiness; It brings a kind of euphoria. There is someone who is ready to forget his past, but there is also someone who carries a bundle of all the memories of his past on his head; Such a person lives a life like a prisoner in jail.\r\nA person who is courageous erases every moment of his past. Instead, he welcomes each coming moment with eagerness and always feels refreshed. In this way the life of such a person becomes a courageous life in itself. But all this can be done only by a courageous person, who knows what the truth is! One who is not courageous, who is afraid of the unknown, who wants to live comfortably among loved ones and acquaintances, can never know the truth nor can face difficulties.\r\nIf you are in a situation where you do not find new friends every day, then enjoy the beauty and goodness of old friends as much as you can, if you are in a situation where friends change every day. If so, that's actually a good thing; Because in such a situation you get the opportunity to make new friends \u2013 you get the opportunity of pure friendship. Pure friendship, friendship without vices, friendship in the true sense has its own beauty.\r\nThe more liveliness there is in life, the more courageous challenges are present. Establishing a friendly relationship with a stranger is full of courageous challenges! To have faith and trust in Him is an even bolder step; It is also a dangerous step.

That is the one true direction, a person who is standing with full consciousness, that is his true direction and only that person can enter through the golden gate.\r\nThe golden gate refers to the present. To live in the present is to pass through the golden gate. If you are not ambitious, then understand that the door of the present is always open for you. Because you have no ambition. You have no desire for power, no desire for wealth and prestige, no desire to attain enlightenment. You don't even have any desire to achieve anything. Therefore there is no ambition to look towards the future, to achieve anything in the future.

Although this will be difficult to do; Because due to old habits, you will start thinking with your mind only. If this happens, become alert, become aware. Don't think; Rather, feel within yourself what is coming to your mind! By doing this you will often get confused and confused; Because you will be unable to know whether that thing is coming from your inner self or your mind? But it is certain that you will soon understand the difference between inner soul and mind.\r\nWhenever there is any instruction from the inner soul, it comes upwards from your navel. At that time you can feel the hot waves towards the upper part of the navel. Whenever a thought arises in your mind, it comes to the upper surface of the brain and from there it moves downwards.

If a rich man becomes generous, know that it is a great transformation; It is a revolutionary event. A rich person can become generous only when he has gained a deep understanding that wealth is useless! Rich people are meaningless to this society. When that person realizes that all the things that this world can give are meaningless; They are valueless, at that time the only thing left is generosity, which we should share.\r\nMan's greatest wealth is his generosity. This is a wealth which does not diminish when distributed. Generosity exists only where there is poverty. No poor man says that he is not generous and no rich man is generous to anyone spontaneously. It doesn't matter to us if we share whatever we have, because we are not stingy. To become rich, it is not necessary to have huge bank balance, all types of movable and immovable capital. The person who keeps collecting things is called miser. Whatever we collect, we cannot take it with us from here. Therefore, it would be better if we do not be stingy in distributing whatever we have stored in our mind. This is generosity.\r\nIf you do not have such an attitude, then you will develop an attitude of acquiring more and more and accumulating more and more. There is no end to this longing. If you do not become alert, alert, then all the prosperity and splendor of this world will be reduced; Because the mind cannot bear the weight of what you have. The mind is never satisfied with material things. The only thing that bothers him is that he needs more. The meaning is that the mind is never satisfied!\r\nThe nature of the mind is that it wants more. The desires of a rich man are never satisfied by the wealth he has; He wants more.\r\nThe conclusion is that generosity is real wealth. The sign of generosity is to share whatever you have. There is no need to acquire or accumulate more. For generosity it is not necessary that you possess Kuber's treasure and keep distributing it.\r\nYou have nothing; Your situation has become like that of a beggar. You have become just a road sign; Still, you can be generous.\r\nHow can the distance between your inner consciousness and the physical pressure on the mind be reduced; For this, study your activities in daily life. Only then can you feel the guidance or signal of your inner consciousness; When your mind is satisfied with your present.\r\nDo you smile when you see a stranger passing by you? You can smile and both of you can exchange your feelings, and when you do that, you are generous. If someone is sad, can't you sing a song? You can be generous at that moment \u2013 your smile and song cost nothing!\r\nRegarding money, you too can become a very rich person; But in real sense you will remain poor; Because you would not like to share anything with anyone. Even your wife, children, relatives, friends etc. will become strangers to you. A miser or a greedy person keeps himself enclosed in a circle from all sides, with no door to meet him. The life of such an insignificant person is like that of a dead body lying in a grave. His inner consciousness is suppressed.\r\nThe question here is not that you should share something! Here the question is about general exchange, which is related to our inner consciousness. You have nothing; But you have a big heart.

It was not completely light yet; Therefore, due to darkness we could not see inside the temple. The king was saying 'My God! I am the dust of your feet; I am not a person! Have mercy on me!' At the same time the priest was praying the same prayer, but the words may have been different, \"I am not a man, have mercy on me.\" - At the same time a third voice was heard in both of their ears and along with the voice there was light. A little light also appeared. In that weak light both of them saw - a poor beggar from the city was praying and saying - 'O Lord! I am the dust of your feet; I am not a person; Have mercy on me!'\r\nThe king blinked his eyes and looked at the priest and said, 'Look! Who is he who is saying that he is not a person but just a beggar? The king may say that he is not a person; The chief priest may say that he is not a man; But a beggar? How arrogant he is! What cunningness! ,\r\nBoth of them started laughing at the beggar's trick that he also wanted to be like the king and the priest! He was also pretending not to be a person. The king and his chief abbot started considering it as an insult. In fact they can say that they are not a person; Because everyone knows that he is not a normal person. Even God knows that they are not like that. He has merely been polite. But that poor beggar? How much humility is there in him!\r\nRemember, your so-called saints and mahatmas are humble in front of God so that they are considered special in the eyes of people. But in reality they are religious, they are spiritual; Those who do not display their humility and modesty, do not pretend to be a normal person. They are normal people, human beings in the true sense.\r\nThe general consciousness of man is extremely incredible; is amazing ! Because it is usually normal. But his ego and pride do not allow him to remain like that. He wants to look different, unusual.\r\nThe moment you have such pride and arrogance, your consciousness does not allow you to remain normal and ordinary. Makes your original nature disappear. At a time when your consciousness is generally normal, in accordance with your nature; At the same time you become amazing and extraordinary in yourself!",

So when death knocks at your door, be ready to welcome death like a ripe fruit. The way a slight gust of wind comes and a ripe fruit drops down from the tree. Sometimes, due to its own weight and complete ripeness, without any gust of wind, the fruit automatically drops, similarly the process of death is also there.\r\nEvery person is searching, has some search or the other; But even after so much searching nothing is found! That moment will be great indeed; When a person stops searching! When there is no search in a person's life; No longing, nowhere to go; Nor is there anything to gain.\r\nDon't be in a hurry to achieve something quickly or quickly.

There is a kind of aroma when ripe. Maturity imparts a beauty to a person's personality; Makes one intellectually mature. Fills you with love. The person's overall actions are full of love; All his inaction is also full of love. The life of a mature person is full of love and his death is also full of love. In a way, he is a flower who keeps showering love on others.\r\nWestern philosophers have interpreted maturity in a different way. He says that a person becomes mature through deep experiences in his life. You have so much life experience that no one can deceive you.\r\nBut such maturity is worldly and temporary. Although in this world you will find many such mature people. But the maturity we are talking about is completely spiritual and permanent. Such maturity makes you easy-going, gentle and generally loving.\r\nYou are connected with existence in such a way that wherever you are present, you remain connected with existence. No matter how much you go into the past or how much you speculate about the future, it has nothing to do with your present.

In today's era, all these troubles have become a norm for humans, which has to be eliminated. We have to get freedom from it.\r\nI only wish that there should be a world where only 'Buddha' is born!

        "card_english_content": "The basic secret is to concentrate while entering the temple of God. The actual meaning of the word listening here is to concentrate; It's about forgetting yourself and listening patiently. When you listen attentively to someone, you forget yourself. Where are you, what are you etc. things become inactive. Unless you forget yourself, you cannot listen to anyone. You can accept it only by focusing your total attention on one point.\r\nWhenever a person listens to something attentively, then understand that he is absorbing it completely. Due to continuous assimilation gradually, its store gets completely filled and its capacity to absorb becomes unlimited and its connection with existence gets connected. If you abandon receptivity, everything you want to receive escapes from you. Therefore, it is necessary that you become a storehouse of unlimited receptivity. If this happens then all your closed doors will open automatically.\r\nReceptivity can be active and productive only when you listen to something and become absorbed in it. If you do this, then you will no longer care who you are. Where are they? What else are you doing! Become inactive in a way.\r\nIf you are completely self-conscious and self-centered, you usually pretend that you are listening; While you don't listen. It is a different matter that sometimes in an accepting posture you indicate acceptance by nodding your head or sometimes you say \u201cyes\u201d, but the truth is that you do not listen! Unless you concentrate patiently, you cannot receive.\r\nThe moment you listen attentively, you continue to receive completely, you become a storehouse, whose capacity for reception becomes unlimited and your connection directly transcends and connects to existence. But remember, by assuming aggression or the attitude of a winner, by abandoning receptivity, you cannot achieve anything new; Attaining God is far away. Not only be receptive, but become a storehouse of unlimited receptivity; The closed doors of all directions will automatically open towards you. At that time you will become the great source of active power. An ocean of womanly receptivity!",

If he thinks that the doubt should go away before he jumps, remember - that time will never come, because doubt is a self-generated process of the individual. Once a doubt arises, a second, third, fourth, etc. is created from it. Exactly the same is the process of developing faith. Once faith is created, the second... third... fourth... etc. is created from it.\r\nWhenever you start something new, a kind of uncertainty surrounds you. No one can start with a whole heart. At that time there is always doubt somewhere; But don't pay that much attention to doubt; Instead, strengthen your faith and belief. Gradually the doubts will reduce and faith will become stronger.\r\nSo keep in mind \u2013 if you think that when the doubts are removed, then you will start; So it is definitely impossible for this to happen.

Instead of establishing friendship, it is better to be friendly to everyone. The feeling of friendship should become a special quality of yours or an identity of your personality.\r\nThe mutual relationship of the entire existence should be friendly.

        "card_english_content": "The joy of living life is different. Every moment, every moment of life is worth rejoicing and celebrating. Make life a game; Live it as a celebration! Then see how much spirituality flows within you! There will be no visible distance between life and temple. Look inside your life! There will be no sadness anywhere. Have you ever seen a tree sad and worried? Have you seen any bird worried and distressed? Have you ever seen any animal vigorous? No; Life is not like that. Nature has its own order; There is specificity. Man can make mistakes, but not nature!\r\nEvery moment of life is meant to be celebrated. Every moment of life is full of joy. You just have to find the source of that happiness. Make life itself a celebration, when you enter the temple, there should be a feeling of joy and happiness on your face. The temple is not for serious people. You look back at your life. Do you see sadness anywhere? No.\r\nMay you always remain normal. Don't try to be clever and very intelligent. Have you seen any creature going mad? Madness is a delusion of yours. Life is not like this. There is some intelligence in our life and there is also some foolishness. Try not to be wiser and more foolish. Life is a tree, try to understand it.\r\nBut, remember one thing here, animals can only play; While man enjoys it; Celebrates the festival. Enjoying, celebrating, celebrating festivals is the exclusive right of only human beings. Animals cannot do this. They cannot rejoice and be happy. Animals can only play. There is a feeling of gratitude and blessedness hidden in joy and celebration. This is a gift given only to man, but it is something to be understood and felt. Existence has poured out its ocean of immense love for us to maintain an atmosphere of joy and celebration. There is a need to squeeze joy from those sources!\r\nTransforming every moment in the flow of life into joy and celebration is a great art of living. Don't stop the feelings of joy rising within you; Don't wait for another moment; You can turn any moment into joy and celebration. You don't need to search for anything. Life needs joy and celebration, and you have it. Life is necessary to celebrate and enjoy. For joy and celebration, trees, birds, moon and stars are needed and they are all available to you.\r\nIf you are a king, you have a golden crown on your head, then you are in a special bond. You cannot celebrate and celebrate your heart; Because till date no one has seen any emperor or king dancing, jumping and enjoying in any street. Because a king or emperor remains imprisoned under certain special formalities.\r\nWhy don't you rejoice? The reason is - something has disappointed you greatly; Because of which you can neither sing nor dance; Nor can we rejoice. Your life has become the life of a handicapped and lame person. You consider yourself very ordinary; In another sense, you are a victim of inferiority complex and frustration. You don't have anything special, because of which your joy and celebration is dead; But who told you that joy and celebration require a special achievement?\r\nYou can enjoy and be happy even by living a normal life. Even your ordinary life will be considered extraordinary compared to others. There is no need for any special occasion or any prior preparation to celebrate. If you keep thinking like this, you will never be able to enjoy. Similarly, life will end while living the life of a beggar.\r\nWhatever path you find to live life, adopt it; Find joy in it and forget all the negative things and have a positive attitude. Dancing, jumping and singing songs are not a part of life. You have many ways to express your inner happiness. Embrace life within yourself. Adopt maximum openness, have maximum sensory access; All those things are scattered around you, which can make your life joyful and festive. You need to change your thinking; To look at life from a positive perspective!",

She is reminding us that external circumstances do not need to be favorable for joy and celebration. We do not need to wait for any special festival or any special day to celebrate. There is no need for drizzle of rain or sunshine to enjoy. Happiness originates from the happiness within a person or his inner happiness. When the same joy crosses the limits, it is expressed in song, dance or laughter, at that time tears of gratitude well up in the eyes.\r\nWhen you select this card, it indicates to you that there are many small and big opportunities in your life, which you can express in joy and celebration. There is no need to wait for a special day, occasion or favorable circumstances to express joy. You can express your joy at any time; Because that happiness is scattered all around you, there is no need to search for it anywhere.",

        "card_category": "Water",
        "card_english_content": "Turning inward does not mean turning completely. Going inward does not mean going inside. The general meaning of turning inward is that you are constantly running through life to satisfy desires here and there, but again and again you fall into the pit of disappointment and frustration. If your every wish is not satisfied, it makes you sad and frustrated. Desires are not satisfied merely by wishing or desiring; You may never reach your goal. In such a situation, inner peace is impossible.\r\nWhen you will understand the truth that running after desires makes you useless, then you will stop running after them. You won't need to make any effort to stop. It automatically gets postponed. Even if you make any effort, your running will start again.\r\nIn the same way, if you make any effort to go into your inner self, then you should understand that you are still running in the outside world. The more you try to turn within, the more you will go outside. All the journeys undertaken are related to the outside, not the inside.\r\nThen how can you go into the inner self? The simple answer is that you are always present within yourself. There is no aim to go up from there. The moment you stop chasing desires, your entire journey also gets postponed. The moment your mind becomes free from the fog of desires, you become stable within yourself. This is called turning inwards.\r\nOnce you are centered within yourself, all your energy cannot move anywhere else. One thing to keep in mind here is that turning inward does not mean that you move inward. When all your energy is concentrated and stable in one place, when there is no activity of any kind, when everything is still and quiet; Everything is closed; You cannot make efforts anywhere seeing the futility of desires. Now you can't go anywhere. There is a permanent energy store inside. The external world is stable; You are totally present. This is called turning inwards.",
        "card_discription": "The woman seen in the picture has a carefree smile on her face. In reality this woman is observing the strange activities of the mind. She is not taking any decision on that. Neither stopping him nor verifying him. She is merely observing; Just like she has become a part of the traffic crowd by standing on the road! Or standing on the banks of the pond; Are you looking at the waves rising on the surface of the water? In such a situation, the clownishness of the mind is making him happy. When the mind is jumping here and there, running towards activities here and there, in such a situation it grabs your attention and wants to force you into the game.\r\nAcquiring the skill to distance oneself from the mind is a great blessing. This is called real meditation. In this neither any mantra is chanted nor any vow is made; Rather, in this process one has to keep an eye on the movement of the mind, in the same way as one has to keep an eye on the behavior of any other person. In this way you can meditate by focusing inside your mind.",

        "card_english_content": "The person who lives in the present; Lives only in the present; He always feels fresh and young. He is neither a child nor an old man! He remains young till his last breath.\r\nAlways remember one thing that the past has no existence in the present. To cling to the past is to cling to death. This is a very dangerous situation; Because in such a situation your life stops; Blocker faces the situation. Its adverse consequences are not only your present; Your future also gets blocked.\r\nSmall children never look back, they always look forward. There is nothing in his past that he can look back on. All that is there for them is their future. An old man never looks towards the future; Because the only thing left for him in the future is death! They keep ignoring him. They always look backwards at their past. All they have are memories of the past. Today, their past seems beautiful to them; But in the past, when they were living in that situation, they could not enjoy it.\r\nThat person remains young till the last breath of his life, who never clings to his past. His body may have aged but his consciousness always remains healthy and young. Time is constant, time neither goes anywhere nor comes from anywhere. In our common language we often say that time is passing. that time has come or such and such time\r\ngone.\r\nTime has been divided into three parts \u2013 past, present and future, but this division is limited to the mind only. The reason for this is that the present does not stay in front of the mind for long, the present very soon becomes the past. Now whatever is in front of the mind is the future.\r\nThe past is that which does not last long before your eyes; The future is that which is not yet in front of your eyes. The present is what is in front of your eyes, but is slowly slipping away and will soon become the past. What is gone is gone. The past can never be the present. Then what is the meaning of being attached to the past and clinging to it? The same thing can be said about the present also. There is no point in clinging to the present; Because this present of yours will soon become the past. Don't cling to future hopes, expectations, fantasies and plans; Because they will all soon become the present and this present becomes the sliding past; Everything is going to be past or present! Everything is slipping out of your hands. Clinging to all this is only inviting misery. Everything will become the past; Then what will be gained by clinging to it and being sad?\r\nYou let it happen, trying to stop it is meaningless; You have to change your perspective. You let events happen; But don't have special expectations from them. Your expectations, hopes, ambitions are the cause of sorrow and disappointment for you. You remain a witness to objects and events. Instead of clinging to them, stay alert and keep an eye on them. Do not keep your mind attached to them; Always remain in an alert state; This is meditation! You remain calm and inner and keep your eyes on time; Keep an eye on them like an eyewitness, all your anxiety, pain, trouble and tension etc. will end.\r\nThis past, present and future are not periods of time. These are all periods of the mind. Past is what has happened, what is happening is in front, that is present and what is going to happen is not in front, that is future.\r\nWhat you lost in the past cannot be brought back in the present. We don't even know what is going to happen in the future; He is invisible. Therefore, whatever is there, is present. Therefore, do not trouble yourself by worrying about yesterday and tomorrow. Always live in the present. But do not cling to the present either, because the present will also become the past very soon.\r\nWhatever we hope, imagine or plan is for tomorrow. How will tomorrow be? What results will it bring? We don't know him. Yesterday is already past. Everything in our life will be done tomorrow. Every moment of time is slipping away, so do not be sad by remembering the past. Only when you forget your past will you find joy and happiness.",

Due to always being stuck in the memories of his past, the doors of his brain are closed and he has become nothing more than a fool! His tattered clothes are a symbol of this.\r\nIt is true that he is not a beggar who can ask anything from anyone; But even more true is that you cannot get the unsought happiness of the present, the joy of automatically available nature; Because you want to live in your past.\r\nThere is an opportunity before you, where you can accept the truth that the past is gone. You cannot relive memories of your past. It is better to remove the box of past memories to which you are clinging and hang it somewhere forever and live in the present and enjoy the happiness available.",

        "card_english_content": "What is dream? Dreams are nothing else, when your desires become desires and start dancing in your imagination, at that time you are unable to recognize the reality that lies beneath your imagination! Reality comes to the fore when your dreams are shattered and fantasies become invisible. If you look at an object in the realm of your imagination, you will still not be able to know the true nature of that object.\r\nWhen a beautiful girl passes by your sight, a desire to acquire it arises in your mind. In the same way, if a handsome young man passes by a girl, a desire to establish her authority over him may arise in the girl's mind. After that you naturally do not try to know its reality or its reality. Instead, that desire of yours starts taking the shape of a dream about the girl. Then your next desire is to meet that girl and \u2013 this is where your colorful fantasies begin.\r\nYour colorful imaginations start jumping out of bounds and when reality explodes, your mind colored with dreams gets shattered, this happens to you often. You fall in love with a woman; At that moment the most beautiful thing in the world is in your imagination; But one day suddenly your dream is broken; Imaginations become invisible. The same woman no longer seems as beautiful to you. Now you don't see her the same way you used to see her. You don't believe yourself how you were betrayed by him?\r\nNeither is anyone cheating you, nor can anyone cheat you. The reality is that your desires and your imaginations deceive you; Because this is your created illusion!\r\nA person cannot stay in the world of dreams for long. Sooner or later the reality sets in. This is the reason why all the love affairs that go on become unstable and uncertain. Lovers and lovers are always afraid that what if each other's reality does not come out as per their dreams and imaginations...? And they keep neglecting to know the reality.\r\nThe wife tries to ignore the husband; The husband tries to ignore the wife. They do not try to look at each other directly; Because they are always afraid. They are aware that the world of imagination has disappeared.\r\nIn case of dream breaking, reality emerges in a different way. Husbands no longer look at their wives the way they used to look at them earlier. What happened to them after all? The reality is obvious to both of them. Now the situation is that dreams can never win against reality. The world of dreams falls apart sooner or later. This keeps happening everywhere.\r\nMan always sees different types of dreams, sometimes power\r\nTo be prosperous, sometimes to gain respect and sometimes to reach a higher level! And when he achieves all this, all he gets is disappointment.\r\nIt is human nature to imagine, dream and wish. This is where dreaming and imagining begin. Remember - man also dreams about those things which he does not have. You can dream of your neighbor's beautiful wife, but you cannot dream of your own wife, no matter how beautiful she is. Whatever remains away from us looks beautiful; When we achieve close intimacy with Him, gradually things begin to change, and reality begins to emerge.\r\nStop dreaming; Being awake means giving up the unconscious sleep in which we normally live; Always be awake and alert, see things as they really are.\r\nOnce you see your dream disappearing, because you have now woken up from your dream, at that time the quality of consciousness will arise within you in a new environment. When you recover from the fog of dreams and are in a waking state, you will feel a distinct change when you wake up the next morning. A change that you have never experienced before! You have woken up from your dream state for the first time. The dream has disappeared, because now awareness has come. You have suddenly woken up from the dream. Now both the dream state and the waking state cannot exist together. When awakening comes, the dream automatically disappears, the entire existence becomes awake.",

The habit of such imagination or dreaming is found eternally not only in children but also in writers, poets and lyricists. The roots of such imaginations and dreams lie in the memories of the past. Instead of coming out of these dreams and imaginations and facing the real world, we often wish to live in those dreams. These are just children's dreams and childish imaginations!\r\nBut those dreams of yours and your beautiful imaginations, which you want to hold on to so cruelly; In other words, the utopia in which you want to live slowly slips away and the reality is exposed in its naked form. To stop him permanently is just a child's dream! None of your close friends or associates, even if they are present, want to share your joy gratefully, and even if they wanted to, they would not be able to do so. True joy and real happiness cannot be achieved by solving our problems; It is impossible to get it from anyone else. True happiness and real happiness are within us, which we can achieve by making our inner self full of love and dignity. At that time we can truly share the joy that overflows within us. As soon as the details of dreams and imagination are removed, reality stands before us.",

        "card_english_content": "You do not see things as they really are, as their nature is! You add your own illusion or illusion to the form of those things.\r\nThe biggest reason for this is that you are afraid to see things directly in their true form. You know very well that they are not as you see them.\r\nYou think that if you see things as they really are, you won't be able to bear it. That's why to reduce the bitterness of truth, you mix your dreams or imaginations in it. In your dream you have covered a person about whom you think that sweetness must have developed in that person. Is it possible ? No, you are deceiving yourself by thinking so; No one else. The result of this is that you find yourself in a very painful situation. The sad situation before you is beyond your imaginations and dreams. Always be careful about this situation. Don't throw your responsibility on others. Otherwise you will start dreaming some other dream. The situation and the scene present in front of you is projected from your own mind, but you are not able to see it. Your vision does not go towards the projection being made from behind.\r\nTake a theater or cinema hall for example. Your eyes remain fixed only on the screen. The movie you are watching is not actually on the screen. It is the projection of shadow and light by the projector from behind, which appears alive on the screen. Your brain remains behind many such objects and keeps playing the role of a projector. You are always looking at others, because the other person is a screen for you! When you are deeply in love with someone, that person is extremely beautiful and incomparable to you; But when you hate that person, he becomes the ugliest person in the world. Perhaps you are not aware of this or do not realize how the same person, who was very beautiful, becomes ugly?\r\nIn reality, whatever we see is external. We either do not try to reach reality or try to get away from it. Our mind is behind all matters, we use the mind like a projector. We always see before others, because there are other people on the screen.\r\nWhen we see something beautiful, we do not think that where there is beauty, there is also flaw. When we love a woman, we find her beautiful. But when the same woman criticizes us on something, then she looks ugly to us. Now the question arises that how can the same person be so beautiful and so ugly?\r\nWhat I mean to say is that no matter how difficult and complex a situation in life appears from the outside, it is not necessary that it is the same from the inside. The role of our mind is more important behind all this. Happiness and sorrow, good and bad, beautiful and ugly, all these are the choices of our mind.\r\nWhen you are in love with someone, that person becomes a garden of beautiful roses for you, there is not even a trace of thorns anywhere. When you dislike that person, start hating him, the roses become invisible, disappear, if there are any left, there are only thorns! And just ugliness; Which you can't see! Have you ever carefully considered where the beautiful roses disappeared in a single minute?\r\nIf you look carefully, you will realize that the center of events is not the person or the screen you see. The reality is that you are the one projecting something. When you project love, that person seems loved; When you project hatred on the same person, that person appears ugly. Don't use your brain to see reality with your mind's eye.\r\nIt's up to your mind to interpret things. Therefore, to know the reality or truth of any thing, it is necessary to immediately study your point of view. Don't use your brain, because the root of all problems is your mind.\r\nYou should see small things for their true nature without putting your mind to it. If you look at a flower, just look at it. Don't say 'Wow! so so beautiful!' Or 'Oops! Very ugly!' Although your mind will feel uncomfortable doing this. But you naturally keep your mind separate. Gradually your ability to discern the truth will increase.",

Both of them are projecting their imaginations on each other, what is in their mind, they want to cover the real face of the other person with their imaginations and dreams. Both of them have their own dreams and their own imaginations, which they want to project into each other. This is the nature of all of us. Where we have attachment and love, we cover it up with our imaginations and dreams. Every person has his own perspective of seeing each other. If that which you consider beautiful and the fairy of your dreams, which you consider to be the world of your dreams, suddenly appears ugly and insignificant, then it is certain that you will try to know its reality by projecting your imaginations and dreams into it. Keep avoiding! How you see others depends on your perspective. If your view is clear or your view is blurry, the object will appear the same!",

He is always engaged in his own protection and security. He remains in self-defense. His access is always protective. For this he continues to struggle. There is always a contrary feeling within him. There is a feeling of hostility. Whatever prayer and meditation he does is a strategy for his own protection.\r\nA person who has faith knows how to let go. A person with faith knows how to surrender. A person with faith knows how to flow with the flow of the river without pushing. He flows as far as the current takes him. He has so much courage and confidence that he can go anywhere with the flowing current. A person who remains fearful and scared does not have the capacity to surrender. Only a man of strong spirit and strong will can surrender, give up everything; Because he has confidence in himself, he is extremely self-confident and can make sacrifices. He has no fear of any kind. He can find the unknown thing, know its reality; Because he has experience of such strange and dangerous journeys. He has the courage to face dangers.\r\nThe life of a person who has faith and trust in others is always full of dangers and troubles. Danger is his refuge; Insecurity is security for him. He wants to reveal the reality. For this he wants to go to the end of existence or sink into the depths of existence. He wants to know more about existence and want to know himself. A person who is strong and capable from within is always ready to surrender himself. He knows that he has no fear in doing so. He considers himself a part of existence. Therefore he does not consider himself a stranger. He considers existence as his everything. Only in existence lies his identity and his existence, otherwise he is nothing! He knows that no one else can play the role he is going to play for survival. That is why he is always ready to search for something in the darkness.\r\nThere are many things which can be achieved by making efforts, but there are also many things which cannot be achieved even by making efforts. Among the things which can be achieved through efforts are worldly wealth, power, respect and prestige etc. Among the things which cannot be achieved even with efforts are love, prayer, meditation, truth etc. One should learn the method of waiting. One must also learn how to abstain from striving! A person must learn how to surrender himself. A person should also learn how to sacrifice, how to leave!\r\nThe most important secret of life is that a person should learn to surrender, learn to let go and have faith in existence.",

This is a very precious moment, which is full of mystery. The seriousness of surrendering oneself and slipping and falling from the leaf is the process of a drop ceasing to exist. In this way the drop loses its identity and connects itself to the existence of water. Now let us imagine the surrender of that drop, that it might have been trembling as it rolled down from the leaf. This situation might have happened when she was hanging between the known and the unknown. Having abandoned the familiar, the drop was now adopting the new and unfamiliar.",

That is why the mind does not move towards new efforts to any extent. Man's mind always remains stuck to his past. He wants to stick to old relationships, relatives and acquaintances only. It is in these that he realizes his skills and abilities. Once you are settled and settled, you feel comfortable and at ease there.\r\nThere are many people in our society who start living with a man or a woman. The reason for this is not that they love each other; In fact they are familiar with each other; Know each other well. Now, if they want to create the same loving relationship with another man or woman, it will be difficult for them, or they will have to make a new effort again.\r\nThe human mind is lazy and lethargic. This slowness and laziness becomes an obstacle for him to make any new effort.\r\nLaziness or laziness is a negative attitude. One should remain brimming with energy. He should be easy and simple, but not dull and lazy. Being lazy or lethargic means that you have given up your creativity or activity for this universe. You are standing aside, away from the action, while the creative process of this universe continues.\r\nwhether you are doing something or not; It is not important for you. You should always be full of energy. The things given by nature always look rich and beautiful. They always look glowing and beautiful. There is no laziness there. Life is not stressful.

Have you ever thought deeply about a flowing river? Sometimes its stream flows sliding towards the left bank, and sometimes it starts sliding towards the right bank. Sometimes it flows towards the north, and sometimes it flows towards the south. Thus you will see that the flow of the river is inconsistent and contradictory; Nothing is certain as to when its shores will change! But there is definitely uniformity in it. That which is hidden, invisible and that is - to end your existence by merging into the ocean! No matter where the river flows, its only goal is the sea!\r\nExpecting to establish uniformity or identity in the minds of people or the uniformity hidden within them is not a part of the society but is related to the entire universe. Society is a man-made organization. All the tendencies of the society, all the events are conducted according to calculations. Society itself has created all the morals or rules, which are stable at one place. This is the reason why moral people and societies have existed together for centuries. Everything keeps changing, but dead rules still exist constantly. Change is inevitable in all things, but most people stick to old rules and customs.\r\nThat person is called moral, who is externally connected with the society. He lives by the rules. But those rules are not for him. He is for the scriptures, the scriptures are not for him! He follows the rules, but does not follow awareness. If you are always alert to awareness, you will be able to achieve hidden coherence. At that time you will not feel the oddity. In fact, even in adverse circumstances, you will experience the inherent positivity within it. You will feel that he is also like a friend! You can use your enemy as a friend. In a hidden, invisible union, both can become one by falling in love together. Anger is man's enemy - but try using it; Make him your friend. Let your love go deep, so that its roots mingle with existence! This is an invisible uniformity - 'Love the enemy; Use the opposite situation also; Because what you consider to be opposite and odd, is actually not so.\r\nIf you prefer one of the two options, it would be wrong. If you choose one, you will become prosperous from it. So let positivity and negativity become a part of the hidden invisible unity between life and death, enemy and friend and love and hate!",

A good swimmer has such deep faith in the river that he becomes one with the river. He does not catch water by jumping while swimming; He does not put up any kind of struggle; It does not remain rigid and taut.\r\nIf you remain firm, stretched and rigid while swimming in the river, you may also drown in the river. If you remain light and comfortable with the river, the river can protect you with its flow. As it is known that whenever a person dies, his dead body floats in water. It's a miracle! The living person dies by drowning in the river water; Whereas the body of a dead person floats on the surface of water. What happened after all? The dead man knows some secrets of the river, which the living man does not know. The living man was struggling, fighting with the flow of the river. The river looked like an enemy to him, he was afraid of the river, he had no faith in it.\r\nOn the contrary, the dead person had no existence there, so how could he have fought? A river cannot drown any dead body. Self-surrender means living life the same way; Just like a good swimmer swims in a river. Life is a river. In the river you either fight or swim; Either you push the water and move against the current or go with the flow till there; As far as the river takes you!\r\nRiver water is never aggressive, it never struggles, never fights. The flow of the river makes its way without any fight and struggle. The flow of the river gives many lessons to humans. The river stream flows across the hard rocks of the mountains. Hard granite walls stand as a barrier on the way, but the river does not fight them. Does not put up any kind of struggle. It flows silently. The sand of the sea or the sand spread on the banks of rivers will make you aware of a heavy secret that 'ultimately the flowing water of the river wins. 'When we used to think that how will we cross these terrible mountain rocks? We had a difficult target in front of us. How can water be victorious? But ultimately water wins. Women's power is very beautiful! So don't be hard like a rock. Be soft and smooth like water. Don't be adamant about conquering water. The flow of the river means the flow of life!

No negative thought arises in his mind that I don't like that path, or I want to go through some other path.\r\nAt every moment of life such challenges or such special opportunities are presented before us; In which we have to choose whether we drown in the flow of life or swim with the current of life or try to swim against the current of the river of life. After studying this card the conclusion is that you are still able to swim with the flow of life. Having faith that the life stream will support you.

Then there will be no question of you being nervous.\r\nNow you must have understood the meaning of controlled life or independent life. But remember, freedom has its own discipline. Freedom does not mean freedom. Discipline should also be created automatically. Discipline imposed from above or by any other force is no less than control. If you are alert and aware, you are automatically controlled and disciplined.\r\nNever apply pressure. Unnecessary control or restraint is a great misfortune for a person. No matter how beautiful any control may appear externally, its internal reaction is very terrible. Under the burden of such double or control, the person abandons his natural nature due to stress and the flow of life starts getting blocked. Freedom has its own discipline; Have your own control.

He is not a moralist. He knows how to forgive. He has his own experience of being forgiven again and again. He knows the limitations of man. Because he has endured a lot while passing through those boundaries. He can forgive; Because he has a deep understanding.\r\nThe moralist does not understand. There is no real information about the actual situation. He can never forgive. Satisfy your ego; He has the illusion of proving himself superior and considering others as inferior. A person who is not moral has to face two types of difficulties. The first difficulty he faces comes from outside. Because by being unethical he starts losing the respect of people. Honor and respect are most precious in this world; Because it confirms people's ego. The moment a person loses respect and honor received in society, the ego gets injured. The second difficulty for the immoral person is internal. When the respect of an immoral person starts getting destroyed in the outside society, at that time he experiences inner terror.

There are many types of resolutions and options in the mind. Everything remains in disarray. Where are you at that time? What are you doing? In this way, you are pushed into internal conflict by having your mind confused about where are you going etc. In such a situation you will not realize that your mentality is innocent.

In such a situation the person's mind becomes unstable. If the task feels difficult, he chooses another option.

You have to go horse riding. Two horses are standing in front of you, one black and the other white. Sometimes your mind tells you to ride on black and sometimes on white. You can't ride both at the same time. If you look for a middle path, you will not be able to reach your destination and precious time of your life will be wasted.\r\nUncertainty of mind, confused state of mind is not a disease.

You can either become absorbed in existence or you can become separate from existence in yourself. Both things are not possible together. To be centered in oneself means to be separate, to be in oneself means to become an 'island' separated from the vast land, surrounded on all sides by the waters of the ocean. Being isolated means building a boundary wall around yourself. To be different means to draw a line between 'this is me' and 'that is not me'.\r\nIn this way, the line of distinction between 'I' and 'not I' means to freeze within oneself like ice. If you like such a life, then it is certain that the flow of life cannot remain dynamic for long. If you are constantly in motion, your 'self' will no longer exist. This is the reason why most people often freeze like solid ice. There is no excitement or warmth within them, they lack love. Since there is excitement and warmth in love, they should not be afraid of love. If there is excitement inside them, they will start melting and the boundary created around them will automatically disappear. No walls exist in love. There is no boundary even in happiness. Because love and happiness are not as cold as ice.\r\nLove is a different name, God is another name. Yet love is better than God. Because God or Ishwar has been destroyed by spiritualists! Whereas love is absolutely pure and spotless.\r\nTherefore, leave your ego, not the world. The world is not a problem.

He stayed with Gautam Buddha continuously for forty-two years and Buddha kept fulfilling every need. It is said that after the death of Buddha, Ananda was with him and kept crying. Buddha's other disciples, seeing Ananda crying, punished him for his misunderstanding and killed him. He should celebrate happily; Must be celebrated! Hearing this, Anand said, 'You all have a misunderstanding. I am not for myself; I am not crying for them, but for myself because I have been with them continuously for so many years, yet could not achieve anything.\r\nAnand remained awake the whole night; He continued to experience deep sorrow and remorse within himself. As the next morning dawned, it is said that he became aware that moments of great sorrow have the potential for tremendous transformation; But for that transformation one has to go deep into the soul; Without blaming anyone; One has to bear it, without pitying oneself!",

        "card_english_content": "Some philosopher has divided the emergence of consciousness into three symbols \u2013 camel, lion and child. Camel is a four-legged burden-carrying animal. He is always ready to become a slave. He never creates trouble or betrays. He can never refuse. He is a faithful follower and a devoted slave or slave. Such consciousness is very rare in humans.\r\nThe lion is a symbol of change; Symbolizes transformation; And it is a symbol of revolution by turning upside down! Revolution or transformation begins with a sense of purity. The need for a person remains in the camel's consciousness; Who takes him and tells him 'you have to do this'. A camel needs ten types of commands. He needs all religions, all priests and all religious texts; Because he does not trust himself. He lacks courage, his soul is dead; No longing for freedom; There is no excitement. He is always obedient.\r\nWhereas Leo loves his freedom. He is always yearning for freedom. He has the desire to destroy every kind of prison and bondage. Leo does not need any leader or leader. That is sufficient in itself. He cannot allow anyone to tell him, 'You have to do this.' It is insulting to Leo to do so. Only he can say that 'I will definitely do it.'\r\nBut a lion does not have the height at which a human is. Only then can he be at such a high peak; When one transforms oneself and feels like a child. One\r\nThe child is innocent. He is not obedient. But he doesn't disobey either. He is not a believer, but not a disbeliever either. He is pure and trustworthy. His eyes are pure and free from defects. It is sacred, acceptable, respected and liberated for the entire existence. Pride is man's self-respect. Pride is a man's false reputation. No one should consider it synonymous with self-respect. Ego takes away your self-respect or your importance; Takes away your majesty; Because ego depends on others, on others' thoughts and what people say. Ego is fleeting. People's intentions and thoughts can change and destroy the ego.\r\nWhen we feel like we are losing life, we start rejecting the demands of others. We separate ourselves from the crowd. After separating from the crowd, we become alone and proud. He is our truth and He is also the creativity of truth. In the end, there is awakening from somewhere within us, there is neither frustration nor disappointment in the awakening that occurs within us. There is a complete awakening. If we allow that to happen, a new revolution will be born. If there is revolution then change will definitely come.\r\nThe choice of camel as a symbol symbolizes a lower level of consciousness, which is probably more appropriate. Minimal consciousness is a sign of man's paralysis; It likes slavery more. A person having such thinking remains afraid of fulfilling his responsibilities. A man with minimal consciousness is ignorant and unintelligent; has been inattentive and dormant; Because till now the burden of external knowledge has been kept on him. This burden of knowledge has been like nectar of faith for that person; Loyalty and trust have been like poison; Symbolizes a commitment to never say 'no' to any command. The person who cannot say 'no' after hearing any command, loses his pride and self-respect. 'Yes' has no meaning for him. Only the one who is capable can say 'No'! Therefore, become a lion and not a burden-carrying camel. The camel has to be transformed into a lion, who likes to die, does not like the life of slavery. Saying 'yes' is contrary to his nature. A child neither knows anything about a camel nor about a lion! He is innocent, it is his nature to forget. There is purity and innocence in his 'yes'. He can say 'no' with full probability. He has no fear, he has complete trust.\r\nThis is the biggest transformation of man.",

Some philosopher has divided the gradual development of consciousness into three symbols \u2013 camel, lion and child. Characteristics of these three symbols are present in humans.\r\nThe camel always remains drowsy; Remains dull and self-satisfied. He always lives in an illusion and thinks of himself as the top of the mountain, but he is so dependent on the opinions of others that he can muster up some courage with great difficulty. Something like a lion emerges from the camel. When we feel like we are wasting life, or wasting it, we reject the demands of others; Say 'no'.\r\nBy now we have passed that crowd; All alone and proudly... with the truth within me roaring like a lion. But life does not end here!\r\nUltimately there is a transformation in the child's appearance. There is neither any acceptance or consent nor any betrayal or disturbance in this process. Instead of all this, he is a symbol of innocence, free will, truth and simplicity. It is from here that you can transform yourself with your gradual emergence.",

When you feel sadness or sadness inside, anxiety and despair, when you feel as if the whole world is against you; From that moment you have to be careful. When you are surrounded by deep darkness from all sides, you have to keep the light on, all these situations become helpful for you.\r\nI don't believe in what other people call meditation. You do it for ten minutes or twenty minutes. After this you fulfill your normal needs for 24 hours. After twenty-four hours you meditate again for twenty minutes. For me, meditation is like breathing. So whatever you are doing, whatever you are, do it with utmost awareness. For example, when you raise your hand, it does not require any consciousness. In that you do it according to your habit; But this action can be done with full awareness. You can feel the difference between a hand raised automatically and a hand raised with full awareness; While the action is the same! The first is habitual and the second is conscious. Try it and you will see that there is a huge difference between the two!\r\nYou try it, because it is a matter of experience. If you're walking, walk consciously for a few minutes, taking each step consciously; So you will be surprised that you will feel a huge difference between normal walking and conscious walking. Along with that you will also feel relaxed. Maintain alertness while eating. In a country like Ethiopia, thousands of people die of hunger every day, whereas in America people die after eating too much food. Those people, who are suffering due to obesity or obesity, also cannot stop eating more.\r\nNo doctor can cure their disease, unless they can stop it themselves or become aware of it. If such people become aware and conscious, then their overeating will gradually reduce. Then they will start chewing and eating. Unless you do this, that is, if you do not chew your food, then you should understand that you are placing an unnecessary burden on your overall digestive system. There are no teeth in your stomach. A person should chew each morsel of food forty-two times. This cycle of life and death continues continuously. This life has not been found for the first time. We come from the unknown and go back into the unknown. Again and again this body dies and is born again and again; But our consciousness, which we know as the soul, never dies.

The more you share your love, the more it grows. The more people you share your happiness with, the more happiness arises within you. This happens only in spiritual economics; Not in physical economics.\r\nThere is an interesting story regarding this subject. A young man recently got a huge lottery prize. There was no limit to his happiness. He stopped his car at a place where a beggar was standing nearby. That beggar had been standing at the same place every day, but before that the young man had not stopped his car. Today everything had changed.

Now you neither have to look backward nor forward! Whoever you are, wherever you are; Are in your present! The present is the only existence.\r\nPay attention - when you are in a state of intensity and completeness in a particular emotion, your selfishness disappears there. Suppose you are in love with someone. There is intensity and depth in your love; So in those moments your selfishness disappears. There you are alone; The same thing also applies to emotions like anger, hatred, lust etc. In such extreme moments, only your emotions like love, hatred, anger etc. remain there. Love becomes invisible in front of 'self' or 'selfishness'. Selfishness occurs only when your mind remains incomplete in any object or action. The feeling of incompleteness is your selfishness.\r\nIf you are completely engaged in painting, playing guitar, dancing, singing or any such art, at that time you will immediately feel that you are not there. There only your art practice remains. Such moments may have passed in your life when, knowingly or unknowingly, you were observing the beautiful view of the sunset and you forgot everything else and got engrossed in that view. At that moment you are no longer aware of your selfishness. At that time you are not present there and have gone somewhere else. At that time you become so united with existence that your ego of 'I' or 'self' no longer exists. Whatever is left after this, you can freely use it for beauty.\r\nExperience, the experience of love, is the experience of pleasant music only. The experience of such moments is natural, which comes and disappears on its own.\r\nA small child always lives in 100 degrees. During that time his every activity is 100% complete. If he starts hating you, he hates you 100%; If he loves, then in totality...! But in the next moment it changes completely. There is not even a moment's delay in changing his attitude. He changes so much in a moment that he doesn't worry about it in any way. Just a moment ago he was sitting on your lap, trying to tell you how much he loves you! But then something like this happens, 'I' 'I will never come to you again'. At that time, look into the eyes of that child, he has the same feeling of distance towards you.\r\nAdopt an approach of living every moment of life to the fullest; So that you don't have to carry the burden of memories of incompleteness throughout your life. When you live a fulfilling life, there will be a coordination of intensity in it and when it ends, you will not dream of getting it again, an overall fulfilling, satisfying and intense way of life can give you only the present and not the past or the future!

And \u2013 if that work is not good; So get out of it. This is the beauty of being complete with totality. This is the art of living life to the fullest. I don't tell you, 'Do this...this is moral or don't do this, this is sinful...immoral...' Nothing like that. The theme here is just this - whatever you do, do it completely.\r\nTo understand the topic, take a step back; All I have to say here is that if you want to be angry at someone, express your total anger at that person; If you get something out of it, enjoy it. If you feel that doing so would be stupid or crazy, then put it off and get yourself out of the situation.\r\nWhen you look back at some of the most common events in your life, you realize that you are fragmented and incomplete. Get completely absorbed in any 'such' activity, and see that while walking on some path, you will take it to the last point of perfection, which you would never have experienced! Then you will start thinking - 'I should have done this.' It was possible, it would have been nice if it had been done! ,\r\nThis is how you start repenting. A sense of guilt starts to feel in the mind. The main reason for this is incompleteness of work. Your mind is always hanging on the thread.\r\nRemember one thing here that if you are completely involved in some work with all your body, mind and wealth, then you can also come out of it completely. If you fail to complete that work, no matter how much time passes, you will never be able to get rid of the memories and regrets of the incompleteness of that work.\r\nThe man who is holistically aware knows that there was no possibility of doing the work much good; Then why remember him? Those who are aware and intellectual do not spoil their present by remembering the past. They don't even bother thinking about the future. They always live in the present and enjoy the present with faith in perfection.",

By taking up many tasks at the same time, you will not be able to fully concentrate your energy and attention on any one task. The result will be that everything will remain incomplete and you will not be able to free yourself from that quagmire. It would be better if you take up one task at a time and complete it thoroughly. During your activism you may also think that the work is uninteresting or 'boring'; Because we have forgotten that this is not what we are doing. Whatever opportunity you get, whenever you get it, make the most of it. By remaining conscious and alert at every step, the entire life starts moving in the same pattern. To be thus completely perfect will be a special gift from God to you.",

If you get success somewhere in life, enjoy it; If you fail, enjoy that too; Because there is a special kind of joy in failure, which success cannot give.\r\nIf you want to succeed in life, all you will be left with is sorrow and regrets. If you want to be successful, and by chance you become successful; So that will not make you complete; Because it all depends on your mind. The reason for this is that if you get what you want in life, it becomes meaningless to you later. After that our mind moves further; To get more than that... then even more than that... it means that our desires are infinite; She is never satisfied. What you get and your desire to get more; The distance between these two always remains.\r\nLook at the waves of the ocean. The higher it rises, the greater is the depth behind it. Similarly, in life, where one wave rises, the other wave keeps on ending. That is, one moment in life is yours, and the next moment goes away from you. If you want to remain at the top in life, it is never possible. One moment is of success, the other moment is of failure. You can make your life balanced, but the condition is that you should not be addicted to success. Just as you celebrate success, celebrate failure in the same way.\r\nWhat this means is that if a person fails in life, then the seeds of his success are sown in that failure itself. Therefore, enjoy life by maintaining a balance between success and failure.\r\nTherefore, if you want to be successful, you can get success, but you cannot remain stable on that success. Then what is the meaning of that success, if after achieving it you do not become stable, determined and satisfied? If the circumstances for you are in accordance with your mentality and due to that, you can also be successful. But mostly the possibility of failure remains. The reason for this is that you are not the only one chasing success! Crores of people chase the same success. Out of one billion population of a country, many people want to become the Prime Minister, but only one person will be successful, right?\r\nIf you fail in your objective, you sink into despair; At that time you start feeling that your life is completely over. Success and failure; Then success and failure; This is the game of life. If there remains a long distance between success and you; So you look for a new way to get closer to success; Even in that, if we are not able to reach success; Then a new way to succeed! This sequence continues, but the distance between your desires and their satisfaction never ends.\r\nMan found another way to escape the cycle of success and failure; Which leads to monasteries and ashrams. They want to escape from the trap of worldly struggles, successes and failures, where they have to face competition at every step. They want to hide in a place where there is no stimulation; Nor any temptation! They just want to live comfortably within themselves in such a place. They do not desire success; One of his new desires is spiritual success! This is a new trick of his. - This is a very beautiful way to free yourself from the conflict of success and failure. Enjoy both. The joy of failure? Yes, suppose you go somewhere, enjoy whatever is available there. If there is success, enjoy it; If there is failure, you will get a different kind of joy in that success, which cannot be found in failure.\r\nA person who is absolutely healthy enjoys his health; But if he falls ill, he enjoys his illness while lying in bed. How is that ?\r\nHe lies comfortably on the bed, doing nothing. He has no worries about worldly matters. Every person in the family takes every possible care of his comfort. He does not get such joy and such feeling of happiness while being healthy. Just like that, there is also the cycle of success and failure.",

In other words, in the beginning of every happiness lies its end. If you keep this in mind and squeeze out every drop of happiness; As you are experiencing now, your future will not be sad.\r\nIf you try to hold on to the joy of your present, you will not be successful in this endeavor.

No one can stop them. This is called existence. All the events related to existence keep happening automatically; There is no need for any struggle or any effort for them. ,\r\nA rich man has everything, as much as he is capable of. Still, one thought keeps roaming deep within him that he has nothing. Due to this thinking, he always experiences stress, disappointment, anxiety and mental unrest. All these factors make that rich person even poorer than the ordinary poor. The reason for this is that the hopes of a poor person are always alive; That's why he is not that poor. He always lives with the hope that one day his luck will open and blessings will be showered on him.\r\nOn the contrary, a rich person has already reached where he wanted to reach. His hopes remain fulfilled. But suddenly he now realizes that nothing is perfect. Despite all his hopes being fulfilled, he continues to feel incomplete. Such a person keeps wandering in a dreamland, away from reality.\r\nIn fact, when everything remains outside, there remains a permanent difference. As a result, the feeling becomes strong in your mind that you are empty from inside, you have nothing. Such a situation echoes the poverty and poverty within you. A rich man knows very well what poverty is; But a poor and destitute person can never know what poverty and indigence is. When you are at the peak of success, suddenly you realize that your behavior is foolish; But you can't say that. You often pretend that you are very happy to maintain your position; But it is not like that! They just try to save face. Despite holding high positions, they feel emptiness and tension within themselves. Once you start understanding all these things, then this world will start appearing to you in a new color and in a new way.

It is not that these events are happening right now; These have already been happening, but till now you have not noticed them. The reason for this is that you were busy in achieving other tasks and objectives, that is why you never paid attention to them. While the birds continue to sing, their chirping continues as before, but you remain untouched by it! Trees and plants continue to flourish and flourish in the same way. The scheduled events of creation continue to happen as before.\r\nYou have to come out of this situation. You have to free yourself from the grip of busyness. Where does your path lead? There is always only one thought roaming in your mind that in the future you may reach some goal. But the question arises that your life is here, then why are you waiting for the future instead of thinking about the present? Why do you ruin your present in hopes of the future? This is very suicidal for you.\r\nThe pace of life is very slow. Why don't you feel it? Looks like you are unconscious, otherwise postponing your present activities and leaving it to the future is suicidal for you. Whatever is in front of you in life, complete it right now; Don't leave it for tomorrow or the future. As easy and simple as it is to become active, it is equally easy to become inactive. There are millions and crores of people on this earth who are constantly active, dynamic, always active day and night without stopping, they neither have time to rest nor to take a break.

Whatever you accept, or accept, is in the conscious state, whatever you reject, goes into the unconscious. This happens only when there is too much pressure and obstruction on your mind. The social garbage that has been rejected by the society is what you are unconsciously going to throw on others. But in doing so you must remember that whatever you reject; Even if you throw it away, it becomes a strong part of your life. In this conflict of the mind, you start the process of repression by rejecting the conscious thoughts and its ill effects remain permanent in the unconscious.\r\nContinuously suppressing thoughts can create a dangerous situation! Psychologists say that eighty percent of human diseases originate from suppression of emotions. Who knows, many incidents of cardiac arrest occur due to continuous suppression of anger. By continuously suppressing the feeling of hatred the heart becomes poisonous. The way to transform the impulse of emotions is different.\r\nIn the process of controlling the emotions, you block their speed by putting pressure on them; Whereas in the process of transformation the emotions are expressed and made clear, the flow of emotions is not blocked. But keep one thing in mind that do not vent your emotions on anyone else. If you do this, the consequences can be fatal for you. On any other occasion, if an emotional state of anger arises within you, the way to transform it is to walk away from there and circumambulate the house seven times. After that, sit under a tree and enjoy the beauty of nature. Where has the anger gone now?\r\nYou did not try to suppress your anger nor did you try to control it. You did not even try to vent your anger on anyone else. If you try to throw or vent your anger on another person, a chain will be formed from there. The reason for this is that if the person on whom you are venting your anger turns out to be as foolish as you and as unconscious as you, then a revolving chain will start from there; The result of which will be that your inner mind will become anxious, frustrated, restless and stressed, which can cause serious diseases. If you make the foolish mistake of venting out your anger on someone else and that person turns out to be as foolish as you, then in response that person will vent out even more anger on you. The result will be the creation of enmity; The end of which becomes difficult.\r\nHow terrible anger is for us, but generally people are not fully aware of its ill effects. You don't need to vent your anger on anyone else; It is better to go straight to the bathroom than to vent your anger on someone else; Go for a long walk somewhere; You will find that inner activity can bring you back to normal by transforming your emotions. To avoid the disaster of anger, you do not need to suppress, control or block your emotions or feelings.\r\nYou do not need any special caution or awareness to control your anger. You need to be intuitively mindful, so that process becomes your nature. Then you will not need any pressure or repression to control the flood of your emotions. The society keeps imposing control on every step, the society never teaches you to be aware or awake every moment of your life. The reason is clear, a waking person has a broader perspective. Through narrow-mindedness he keeps himself aloof. On the contrary, it becomes a permanent mentality of a person who strictly controls his emotions or feelings. Society suggests various types of controls on such people. Society advises you to stay locked in a cave; In which there is no hole to peek out!\r\nRemember one thing here - when nothing can go out from inside you; Neither can anything come in from outside; You have closed yourself off in this way; So in such a situation no beauty from outside can touch you. Eyes cannot perceive beauty. In a way you are living in an emotional state. In a way, you are bearing the brunt of the unconscious state and - all this is the bad result of suppressing anger and forceful control. Your consciousness develops along with your awareness. If you repress, control and inhibit your emotions; So such a life, while alive, is like a dead one.",

This is the same power from which the whole world derives educational energy, brain energy, power of thoughts, imaginative power and thinking power. The brain uses these powers.

When you stop thinking, you discover unlimited power and adaptability.\r\nThe glow of that power source is within you; Not outside you. If you search for it outside, your search will be in vain.
